## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a full-stack engineer with hands-on experience designing and shipping real-world web platforms across multiple industries, including education systems, hotel management platforms, iGaming/casino products, and content-driven company websites.

My core strength lies in **JavaScript-based systems**, with a strong focus on **TypeScript**, backend architecture, clean APIs, and scalable application design. I care deeply about code quality, long-term maintainability, and building software that solves real business problems—not just demos.

I’m currently open to **remote opportunities with US-based teams**, where I can contribute as a reliable, product-focused engineer.
