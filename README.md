I’m a full-stack engineer with hands-on experience designing and shipping real-world web platforms across multiple industries, including education systems, hotel management platforms, iGaming/casino websites, and content-driven company blogs.

My core strength is JavaScript-based systems, with a strong focus on TypeScript, backend architecture, clean APIs, and scalable application design. I care deeply about code quality, maintainability, and building software that solves real business problems—not just passing demos.
