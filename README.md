👋 💗 **Hi, I’m Joshua Ugarte** 💗
- Full-Stack JavaScript Engineer
- Building production-grade web applications since 2019

👨‍💻  **About Me**

I’m a full-stack engineer with hands-on experience designing and shipping real-world web platforms across multiple industries, including education systems, hotel management platforms, iGaming/casino websites, and content-driven company blogs.

My core strength is JavaScript-based systems, with a strong focus on TypeScript, backend architecture, clean APIs, and scalable application design. I care deeply about code quality, maintainability, and building software that solves real business problems—not just passing demos.

I’m currently open to remote opportunities with US-based teams, where I can contribute as a reliable, product-focused engineer.
